# Data Science Toolbox

A docker microservices "box" hosted in docker with a java main GUI app. Created for CS1660, Intro to Cloud Computing, University of Pittsburgh.

## Prerequisites

Access to some sort of X11 tunnel, like Xquartz.

Docker installed on the host machine.

NOTE: this software was tested on macOS Big Sur and very briefly on Windows 10. I cannot speak to issues with other operating systems.
